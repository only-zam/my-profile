# How this works.

Some months ago, I was working on a web portal for a construction company.

I had been contracted to build an application that;

- Accepts user input for window measurements and specifications

- Process these measurements and specs into the required materials for each window

- Calculate total costs of said windows


I knew that simplicity and robustness was key for such a solution so I opted to use the simple yet very solid language: Javascript, HTML and Css

So I cranked up my Intellij IDE and got down to business

I followed my usual work process, worked for days and nights and I thought to myself:

> I did it...Let's goooooo

And indeed I had built a masterpiece of a system. The directors of the company were really happy with what I had delivered.

I still run and maintain the application but have delegated some functions to their IT.


## The result of working hard:

You can see the website live: [Capitalbuilders.co.ke](http://www.capitalbuilders.co.ke/)

You can also find the git repository for the app at: [GitHub](https://github.com/only-zam/building-quotes-webpage/)

## What I learned from it:

- Use all the resources, and choose the one that you feel comfortable with. Everyone's way of teaching is different, so you have to find that.
- Whenever you want to start something, it is going to be hard but always do it anyways. <br />
